This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android APK. The build process fails with the following error message:

`Execution failed for task ':app:transformClassesWithDexBuilderForDebug'.
> com.android.build.api.transform.TransformException: java.lang.RuntimeException: com.android.ide.common.process.ProcessException: org.gradle.process.internal.ExecException: Process 'command '/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/bin/java'' finished with non-zero exit value 2`

This error is often caused by a conflict between different versions of libraries used in the project, specifically the AndroidX libraries.  It might also be related to issues with ProGuard or R8.
