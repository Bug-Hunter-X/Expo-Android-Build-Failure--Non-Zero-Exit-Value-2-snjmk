The solution involves meticulously reviewing the project dependencies and configuration. The steps are:

1. **Clean and Rebuild:**  `expo prebuild --clean` followed by `expo build:android`
2. **Dependency Resolution:** Examine the `package.json` file and ensure that there are no conflicting versions of AndroidX libraries. If found, resolve conflicts through version pinning or other dependency management techniques. You might use a tool to analyse for transitive dependencies.
3. **ProGuard Rules (if used):** If ProGuard or R8 is being used, add necessary rules to the `proguard-rules.pro` file to prevent the obfuscation or removal of essential classes. Pay close attention to exceptions to keep critical methods and fields intact.
4. **Native Modules (if used):** Verify that the native modules used in your application are properly integrated into the Android build process. If any issues are present with native module build, try reinstalling the native modules.
5. **Gradle Configuration:** If necessary, modify the Gradle configuration files (`android/build.gradle` and `android/app/build.gradle`) to adapt build settings. These adjustments are highly problem-specific and require a detailed understanding of the Gradle build system. 
6. **Expo SDK Version:** Check if upgrading or downgrading the Expo SDK resolves the issue. Incompatibility with the SDK version sometimes causes this build error.

If the issue persists, examine the complete build output for further clues about the root cause.
